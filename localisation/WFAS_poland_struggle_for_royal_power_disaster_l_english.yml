Mikolaj Zebrzydowski, Jan Szczesny Herburt, Stanislaw Stadnicki, Aleksander Józef Lisowski and Janusz Radziwill have formed a rokosz, or semi-legal rebellion, in Stezyca and Lublin. The nobles have gathered at the rokosz formed a Konfederacja which outlined demands in 67 articles, demanding the dethronement of [Root.Monarch.GetName] for breaching the Henrykian Articles, and the right for the Sejm to appoint state officials instead of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
