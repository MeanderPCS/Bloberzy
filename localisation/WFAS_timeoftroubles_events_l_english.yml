 WFAS_tot_son_title:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] kills [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] son"
 WFAS_tot_son_desc:0 "While walking around the court, [Root.Monarch.GetName] assaulted his son's wife, Yelena Sheremeteva, for being inappropriately dressed. She was pregnant, and the beating caused a miscarriage. The Tsarevich reprimanded his father, and the Tsar responded by accusing his son of inciting rebellion by challenging his father and advocating attempts to relieve the on-going Siege of Pskov. [Root.Monarch.GetName] struck his son with his sceptre, and also struck Boris Godunov when he tried to intervene. The Tsarevich fell to the floor bleeding heavily. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was quickly remorseful, but his son died a few days later."

 WFAS_tot_feodor_title:0 "Feodor's Regency"
 WFAS_tot_feodor_desc:0 "In November 1581, Feodor's elder brother was killed by their father in a fit of rage. His death meant that Feodor became the heir to his father's throne. He had never been considered a candidate for the Russian throne until that moment, and was not a little daunted by the prospect. One year later, in October 1582, his father's latest wife bore a son, Dmitry of Uglich, who was Feodor's only surviving sibling. Ivan the Terrible died in March 1584, and Feodor became Tsar. Two months later, on 31 May 1584, he was crowned Tsar and Autocrat of all Russia at Dormition Cathedral in Moscow."

 WFAS_tot_godunov_title:0 "Boris Godunov"
 WFAS_tot_godunov_desc:0 "A pious man of retiring disposition, Feodor took little interest in politics, and the country was effectively administered in his name by Boris Godunov, the brother of his beloved wife Irina. He legitimized himself, after Ivan IV's death, as a de facto regent for the weak and disabled Feodor. Feodor's failure to sire other children brought an end to the centuries-old central branch of the Rurik dynasty (although many princes of later times are descendants of Rurik as well)."

 WFAS_tot_dmitry_dead_desc:0 "The last living Rurikid heir to the Russian throne, Dmitry of Uglich, was found dead today, bled out in the bushes, with his throat slit. This divided the Russian nobility, with some saying that this the work of Godunov's assassin, while others claiming it to be the result of an epileptic seizure while he had the knife in his hands."

 WFAS_tot_pol_dmitry_desc:0 "Grigoriy Otrepiev entered history circa 1600, after making a positive impression on Patriarch Job of Moscow with his learning and assurance. Upon hearing of this, Tsar Boris Godunov ordered the young man to be seized and examined, whereupon Dmitry fled to Prince Constantine Ostrogski at Ostroh, of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and subsequently entered the service of the Wisniowieckis, a polonized Ruthenian family. Two family members in particular, the princes Adam and Michal Wisniowiecki, were intrigued by the stories Dmitry told of whom he purported to be, as it gave the Poles real opportunity to capitalize on the political rancor rising in Moscow. The Wisniowiecki brothers, along with Samuel Tyszkiewicz, Jan Sapieha, Roman Rozynski, and several other Polish noblemen soon agreed to fully back the man, and his claim, against Tsar Boris Godunov. In $YEAR$, Dmitry visited the royal court of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in $CAPITAL_CITY$."

 WFAS_tot_false_dmitry_title:0 "False Dmitry!"
 WFAS_tot_false_dmitry_desc:0 "Being crowned Tsar, Dmitry ruled somewhat normally, though people have grown suspicious of him. He was catholic, dressed in Polish clothes, and surronded himself with Polish noblemen. Vasily Shuisky, a powerful noble in the Russian court, got fed up with this, and gathered nobles to demand abdication from the foreign impostor."
 WFAS_tot_false_dmitry_remove:0 "Begone, Pole!"

 WFAS_tot_second_dmitry_title:0 "The Second Dmitry"
 WFAS_tot_second_dmitry_desc:0 "After the first False Dmitry was expelled, shortly after the second one appeared. Now though, he was a mere figurehead for the influential noble families of [Root.GetName] and [WFAS_tot_dmitry_target.GetName], and overall everyone who opposed other candidates and wanted influence in the new Russian court. It is hard to say if the nobles were supporting him or if he rallied them to get the throne, but the problem is unsettling."

 WFAS_tot_poland_intervention_desc:0 "The failure of both Dmitrys to seize the Russian throne had quite the irritating effect on [Root.Monarch.GetName].
